<h1>The Best Movies According to Nancy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Intruder</h3>
<p>This is a very interesting movie. The plot is amazing. It also features Michael Ealy, one of my favourite characters.
</p>
<h3>Desperate Lies</h3>
<p>Not really a movie but a series. I just think it's beauifully done.</p>
<h3>The Equalizer</h3>
<p>It's one of Denzel Washington's master pieces.</p>
